what if anything to do about interupted jobs/partial zips



validate running on PS 7.x before continuing to script
or just do a bool with if [-2] to see if current version of PS will support it?
either way something to do up front



some way to validate zip file names
in case there's both
 Horizon_Chase_12152024_steam.zip
and
Horizon_Chase_12152024_steam - Copy.zip
or some such nonsense

also some kind of 'trim' applied to make sure there's no spaces before or after the file name

timer of zip operations (Measure-Command)

ideas: with or without -what-if use a -create-answerfile
then to use answer file use -answerfile:file.txt

also default to displaying the operations that are going to happen with a "press any key to continue" pause
and use a -noPrompt to not pause to press a key

also a way to limit max size of folders. like back up only folders less than 20 gigs or 50 gigs

random idea: when compress-archive finishes and return a "success" 0 or whatever, do a md5/whatever hash on it and keep that
well it was supposed to be for catching zips that are only part way created but a patched folder would produce a zip with a different 
hash anyway so not that great of an idea


also feed in a bare list of folder names only back up that list?
i mean the out put of dir /b
or the ps equivalent

this text file with one folder per line for selective compression could then be utlized in a hypothetical selective decompression companion script

notes: running with empty string for answer file:
 pwsh -command '& { .\steamzipper.ps1 -sourceFolder "P:\steamzipper\steam temp storage" -destinationFolder "P:\steamzipper\zip test output" -createAnswerFile ""  }'
script just runs normally, to extra information for the user

running with no file and no file name or quotes at all
pwsh -command '& { .\steamzipper.ps1 -sourceFolder "P:\steamzipper\steam temp storage" -destinationFolder "P:\steamzipper\zip test output" -createAnswerFile   }'

is maybe hard to follow error
steamzipper.ps1: Missing an argument for parameter 'createAnswerFile'. Specify a parameter of type 'System.String' and try again.
but quits immeidately

grok suggested a default json file (answer.json?) when no is specified. may have to come back to that

i think the -createnswerfile is actually broken. i'm not sure it really takes the parameters used and puts them into a
anserfile txt file, i think it defaults to a set of parameters. It's fine. 





running with line:
pwsh -command '& { .\steamzipper.ps1 "P:\steamzipper\steam temp storage" "P:\steamzipper\zip test output" -debugMode -VerbMode -keepDuplicates -CompressionLevel Fastest }'
