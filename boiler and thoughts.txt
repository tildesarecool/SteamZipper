some way to validate zip file names
in case there's both
 Horizon_Chase_12152024_steam.zip
and
Horizon_Chase_12152024_steam - Copy.zip
or some such nonsense

also some kind of 'trim' applied to make sure there's no spaces before or after the file name

timer of zip operations (Measure-Command)

ideas: with or without -what-if use a -create-answerfile
then to use answer file use -answerfile:file.txt

also default to displaying the operations that are going to happen with a "press any key to continue" pause
and use a -noPrompt to not pause to press a key

also a way to limit max size of folders. like back up only folders less than 20 gigs or 50 gigs




also feed in a bare list of folder names only back up that list?
i mean the out put of dir /b
or the ps equivalent

this text file with one folder per line for selective compression could then be utlized in a hypothetical selective decompression companion script



















running with line:
pwsh -command '& { .\steamzipper.ps1 "P:\steamzipper\steam temp storage" "P:\steamzipper\zip test output" -debugMode -VerbMode -keepDuplicates -CompressionLevel Fastest }'
