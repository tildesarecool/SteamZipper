# SteamZipper
Loop through steam games folder, zipping each folder and giving it a username (PS edition).

I'm not assuming this exact script hasn't already been done 
in many other languages many, many times before. I'm just 
doing this to try and backup my steam games. And practice 
PS scripting.

I made quite a bit of progress today on the re-write. I'm going one very small increment at a time. I got as far as zipping some folders but there's still a lot left.

First version written Oct. 15th. Okay I didn't write it an AI did. Which is why I'm trying to re-write it from scratch as the original currently doesn't work. I had a working version. I asked for new features and now it doesn't work. Instead of reverting to the working version I'm re-writing it myself. It's better this way anyway.
